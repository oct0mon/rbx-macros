# rbx-macros Documentation

## Is It Bannable?

No. These macros **do not modify or inject code** into the Roblox client.
They only **emulate key presses**, **scan for pixels or images** and other stuff.

However, **use them responsibly**:
Some games may consider certain macros as cheating.
Macros that could be flagged as unfair will include a **warning icon (⚠️)** in their documentation.
