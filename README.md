# rbx-macros

An open-source Roblox macros repository.

## Project Structure

All macros inside `src/universal` folder, can be used for any Roblox game, any macro that is not inside this folder can only be used in the games they were made for.

Also macros inside `src/lib` should not be used, they are only used internally by the other macros, these aren't made for any game, just to be used as utility macros that other macros may use, so don't edit/delete them!

> **NOTE**:
> You can close any macro by pressing `CTRL + F4`
